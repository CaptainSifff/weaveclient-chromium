Firefox Sync for Chromium
=======================

This is an EXPERIMENTAL extension for the Google Chrome browser
(a.k.a. Chromium).  It allows one to synchronize bookmarks and tabs
with the Firefox Sync service.

Right now this extension is far from feature complete but it can talk to the
sync server and read and write data.

Development is ongoing.
