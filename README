Weave Sync for Chromium
=======================

This is an EXPERIMENTAL extension for the Google Chrome browser
(a.k.a. Chromium).  It allows one to synchronize bookmarks and tabs
with Mozilla's Weave service.

As Google Chrome extensions are implemented in pure JavaScript, this
essentially contains a Weave client implementation in that language.
It can therefore be used in other browsers as well, for instance by
embedding it into a website.  However, since AJAX requests are subject
to the same-origin policy, queries to the Weave storage nodes will not
work directly but have to be handled by the web application in
question and then forwarded to the corresponding Weave storage node.
A simple application of this kind for the Google App Engine platform
is contained in this directory as well.  It can be tried out under
http://weavebrowser.appspot.com.
